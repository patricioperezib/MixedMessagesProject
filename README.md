## General Information
- This is a JavaScript Syntax Portfolio Project in the Full-Stack Engineer Career Path from Codecademy.
- The purpose of this proyect is to build a message generator program using JavaScript, Git version control, command line and develop it locally on personal computer.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line

## Features
- The program creates a message making use of three different segments. Each segment refers to a time in your life: past, present and future. 
- It has 3 possible sentences for each period of time. So the total possible messages are the result of the combination of 3X3X3.
